# [GPGD] Project Penguin

## Description

Project Penguin is a 2D-Sidescrolling Jump’n’Run about a Penguin, who is collecting fish and avoiding enemies at the Antarctica.
Meanwhile the level is slowly warming up and changing into a deadly environment due to climate change.
This Project is part of the "Graphics and Game Development" Lab in Summerterm 2020.

## Setup

You need visual studio to open the .sln-file. The only other dependency currently needed is that [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) should be installed.
To do that, you need to copy the "glew32.dll" from the Dependencies-Folder to %SystemRoot%/system32 (see [here](http://glew.sourceforge.net/install.html) for more information).
In visual studio, the configuration used by me for development is "Debug" & "x64". If there still are problems running the program, please [contact me](<uexdy@stud.kit.edu>).
