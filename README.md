# [GPGD] Project Penguin

## Description

Project Penguin is a 2D-Sidescrolling Jump’n’Run about a Penguin, who is collecting fish and avoiding enemies at the Antarctica.
Meanwhile the level is slowly warming up and changing into a deadly environment due to climate change.
This Project is part of the "Graphics and Game Development" Lab in Summerterm 2020.

## Setup

You need visual studio to open the .sln-file.
In visual studio, the configuration used by me for development is "Debug" & "x64". If there still are problems running the program, please [contact me](mailto:<uexdy@stud.kit.edu>).
