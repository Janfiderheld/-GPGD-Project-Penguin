![Example Gameplay Image](https://github.com/Janfiderheld/-GPGD-Project-Penguin/blob/master/Project%20Penguin/Assets/Documentation/ExampleImage.png)

## Description

Project Penguin is a 2D-Sidescrolling Jump’n’Run about a Penguin, who is collecting fish and avoiding enemies at the Antarctica.
Meanwhile the level is slowly warming up and changing into a deadly environment due to climate change.
This Project is part of the "Graphics and Game Development" Lab in Summerterm 2020 at the KIT.

## Playing the game

You can find a playable version under ["Releases"](https://github.com/Janfiderheld/-GPGD-Project-Penguin/releases).
This version can be played without the need to install anything. It was compiled and tested on windows platforms.

## Project Setup

You need visual studio to open the .sln-file. In visual studio, the configuration used for development is "Debug" & "x64", but every other should work as well.
If there still are problems running the program, please [contact me](mailto:<mussundtoeberg@yahoo.com>).
